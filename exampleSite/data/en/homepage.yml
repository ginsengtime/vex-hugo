    content: A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these
      sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and
      feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
      souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite
      sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
