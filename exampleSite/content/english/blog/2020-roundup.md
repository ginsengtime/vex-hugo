**What's this?**

As we close out the year, we thought it would be fun to make a list of all the books that, for one reason or another, didn't quite make it into our boxes. We hope you look out for them at your local library or indie bookseller! You can also click on each of the titles to purchase them online.

 
**Why didn't these books make it?**

There are many reasons why we choose not to go with certain books. Sometimes, they're out of print or unavailable for purchase. Sometimes, they cost too much. Sometimes, they're too big to fit in our boxes. Sometimes, we find out about a book way too late and go, "Darn it! This would have been perfect for [insert month here]." Often, we simply feel that the book doesn't quite fit our theme, or that there's a better book we'd like to offer instead, or that we'd like to promote the work of a lesser-known author. It tends to be a mix of availability, luck, and personal taste.

 

**So, we'll never see these books in New Suns boxes?**

Never say never! There are many books and authors on this list that we continue to keep in mind for future boxes, and we look forward to the day we can finally offer them to you.
